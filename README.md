# KmerGMA-suppplemental-material
Repository for analysis scripts, data, and general supplemental information for Utst√§llningen Ungaforskare finals 2023.

The repository is incomplete and will be updated very soon with more data and analysis scripts.

However, it is noteoworthy that since the 12th of march, the main method and package has a very large volume of the changes and the results mentioned in the report may not be  100% replicated now. However, the new results are definitively better than the old versions.

# Repository organization
## Analysis_scripts
Currently, all it contains is a jupyter notebook of the derivation of a more computationally efficient formula for updating the kmer distance as the window iterates in KmerGMA. Unfortunately, even though the dervied formula is indeed more efficient theoretically, it barely gave any performance input in the practical implementation. 

## Sequences
Currently just contains the 88 alpaca references sequences used in the report.

## Miscallaneous
Currently just contains a jupyter notebook I used to generate the animations that were used in my presentation video
